# ICS4U1 Projects

## Replit Project Downloader
This repository contains a series of scripts (in `_replitManager`) to download, sort, organize, clean and commit my Java projects from Replit. The downloading script is written in JavaScript and uses Selenium to download all the projects. The sorting script is written in bash.

## Java Projects
All the Java projects are at the root of the repository, and are organized by the order they were assigned in.
