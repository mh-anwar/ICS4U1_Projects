# Replit Project Downloader
This repository contains a series of scripts (in `_replitManager`) to download, sort, organize, clean and commit my Java projects from Replit. The downloading script is written in JavaScript and uses Selenium to download all the projects. The sorting script is written in bash.

## Steps to Use

# `npm run download`
This will execute a Node.js script that will download all of your projects from Replit. It uses Selenium to automate the process of downloading the projects. 

# `bash projectSorter.sh`
This bash script will organize, extract and clean all the projects. It will then add and commit them to the repository.

# Final Step
You must add a remote origin to the push the changes too and actually push the changes.
